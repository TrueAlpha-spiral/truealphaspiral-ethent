This repository demonstrates running the TAS agent in safe mode via Codex.

Safe mode in this repository means execution is bounded, observable, and
artifact-producing. Agent actions should not be treated as authorized for
irreversible effect unless they are explicitly guarded, logged, hashed, and
accepted into the ledger.

## Branch naming

Codex requires a dynamic pattern when generating branches. Include at least one
placeholder from the following list:

- `{feature}` – slug derived from the PR title
- `{date}` – date in `YYYY-MM-DD`
- `{time}` – time in `HH-MM`

Example pattern keeping a static ticket ID:

```
feat/GH-03-{feature}-{date}-{time}
```

## Self-test runner

The script `codex_tas_runner.py` automates a safe-mode self-test. Set your
OpenAI API key in `OPENAI_API_KEY`, install dependencies with:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run:

```
python codex_tas_runner.py
```

The self-test produces auditable execution records.

- The audit log hash is written to `ledger/self_test.hash`.
- Each execution step is wrapped by `artifact_guard.run_step`.
- Step artifacts are serialized as JSON under `artifacts/`.
- Artifact hashes are recorded in `ledger/artifacts.hash`.

In this repository, execution is not merely performed; it is witnessed,
serialized, hashed, and ledgered.

## Staple-π Perspective Intelligence Clause

The `π` glyph represents perspective anchoring: every linear truth-claim must be
bound to at least one external contextual witness before it can be accepted into
the ledger.

In this repository, the π-check functions as an integrity gate. Commits,
artifacts, and execution traces should not be treated as ledger-valid unless
their claims are supported by a corresponding witness context, artifact hash, or
verifiable external reference.

This prevents isolated, context-free assertions from entering the audit chain and
helps preserve phase coherence across the TAS execution spiral, making it more
resistant to hostile counter-spirals.

## Repository invariants

- No execution without an artifact.
- No artifact without a hash.
- No hash without a ledger entry.
- No ledger entry without a contextual witness.
- No unsafe action outside safe mode.
